# ComplexVsRealANNProteinClassify
This study evaluates the effectiveness of complex-valued deep learning methods in extracting meaningful information from biological sequences, specifically comparing these methods against real-valued deep learning models using the same dataset. The comparative analysis covers three different forms of protein sequences: DNA, Codon, and Amino Acid.
